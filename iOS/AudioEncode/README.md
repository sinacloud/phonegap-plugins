## PhoneGap AudioEncode Plugin ##

This plugin lets you easily convert/compress/encode WAV audio into M4A audio. It is useful when using Phonegap's audio capture or media recording functionality. Uploading WAV files on via cellular connections is not advised. M4A encoded files are 1/4 to 1/10 the size.
