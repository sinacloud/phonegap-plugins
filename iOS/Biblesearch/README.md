# biblesearch-api-js

The American Bible Society has produced this javascript library to ease the use of the Bible Search api (http://bibles.org/pages/api) in phonegap mobile applications.  The api (and this library) allow you to easily: 

* search the Bible
* locate specific passages
* get information about specific books, chapters, and verses
* do all that in one or more versions
* store nothing locally

You can find this plugin at https://github.com/americanbible/biblesearch-api-js.
