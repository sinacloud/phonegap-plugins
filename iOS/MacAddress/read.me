MacAddress plugin for Phonegap (Cordova) 
By Joey Wong (Huang Jun Yan) Updated for Cordova 2.4.0


This is the plugins to help you get the iOS WIFI MAC address 

The UDID API is deprecated in iOS 5. To get a unique identifier, maybe you need to turn to iPhones' MAC address instead.


INSTALL
=========================

1. Drag the <code>Macaddress.h, Macaddress.m </code>into the <code>"Plugins"</code> folder in Xcode.

2. Attach the <code>"macaddress.js"</code> to your <code>www</code> folder

3. Don't forget to enable the plugins in Cordova <code>config.xml</code> (for Cordova 2.3 or higher)

Add this:

<plugin name="Macaddress" value="Macaddress" /> 


For older version, please modify the PhoneGap.plist file of your application. Under the key "Plugins" add another one with key name
Macaddress and value Macaddress. 

How to use
==========================================
Get the WIFI MAC address by following script :


plugins.macaddress.getMacAddress(function(response){
                                    alert('MAC Address:'+response);
                                  },function(errorMsg){
                                    alert('Error:'+errorMsg);
                                  });


Voila !
